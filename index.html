                    <p>Unfortunately, my previous work experience had nothing to do with IT. I worked as a specialist in
                        the field of agriculture, where I was engaged in crop</p>

                    <p>A year ago, I was offered to change jobs and try to apply my experience in an IT company. The
                        company was developing its own software.</p>

                    <p>Our application processed a huge number of satellite images and transformed the data into a
                        graphical representation of the intensity of plant growth on the soil surface.</p>

                    <p>Our application processed a huge number of satellite images and transformed the data into a
                        graphical representation of the intensity of plant growth on the soil surface. In the company,
                        my responsibilities included training our customers to use our software, testing the application
                        and participating in improving the functionality of our product. While working for the company,
                        I decided not to stop and find for myself IT courses where I could gain additional skills in the
                        field of development and become more useful for my company.</p>

                    <p>My interest led me to the RSScool courses. I really hope that I will be able to acquire the
                        necessary skills in the field of development and get the opportunity to create new projects!</p>

                    <p>At the moment I do not have programming skills, but I really hope that in the near future I will
                        acquire the necessary knowledge in the field of programming!</p>
